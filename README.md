## 🛠️ About Me

I’m a driven Computer Science graduate with a strong interest in developing intelligent, data-driven solutions for real-world problems. My academic background and personal projects focus on applying machine learning, agent-based modeling, and automation systems to areas such as environmental monitoring, water resource management, and healthcare support.

I believe in the power of technology to simplify lives, optimize processes, and make meaningful contributions to sustainable and human-centered development.
